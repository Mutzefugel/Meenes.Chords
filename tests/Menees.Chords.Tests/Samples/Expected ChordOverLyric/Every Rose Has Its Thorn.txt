[Verse 1]
G Cadd9 G Cadd9
G                                   Cadd9
  We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
            G                                Cadd9
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
           G                  Cadd9
Was it something I said or something I did
             G                 Cadd9
Did the words not come out right
         D
Though I tried not to hurt you
         Cadd9
Though I tried, but I guess that's why they say


[Chorus]
G                  Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn
          G                   Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn
          G       D            Cadd9        G
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
                   Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn


[Verse 2]
G Cadd9 G Cadd9
G                                            Cadd9
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
          G                                    Cadd9
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
         G        Cadd9
But I wonder does he know
        G                Cadd9
Has he ever felt like this
          D
And I know that you'd be here right now
    Cadd9
If I     could have let you know somehow I guess


[Chorus]
G                  Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn
          G                   Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn
          G       D            Cadd9        G
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
                   Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn


[Bridge]
Em                    D
   Though it's been a while now
      Cadd9              G       g f# (bass notes)
I can still feel so much pain
Em                   D
   Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
Cadd9                        G
     But the scar, that scar remains


[Solo]

[Verse 3]
G Cadd9 G Cadd9
G                                                    Cadd9
  I know I could have saved a love that night If I'd known what to say
G                                Cadd9
  Instead of makin' love We both made our separate ways
          G                  Cadd9
But now I hear you found somebody new
    G                       Cadd9
And that I never meant that much to you
   D
To hear that tears me up inside
       Cadd9
And to see  you cuts me like a knife I guess


[Chorus]
G                  Cadd9
Every rose has its thorn
          G                   Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn
          G       D            Cadd9        G
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
                    Cadd9 * G
Every rose has its thorn        * E:0 E:2 A:0 D:0 E:0
