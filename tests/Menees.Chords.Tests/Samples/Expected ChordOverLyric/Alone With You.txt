[Verse 1]
           G     C               G
I see your face across a crowded room
           G        C                 Em
I hear you say that you'll be leaving soon
            G        C          Em
I know it's late but all that I can do
   C                 D                         G
Is close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you


[Verse 2]
            G              C                          G
I'd like to talk to you so much but I don't know your name
              G            C                          Em
I bet there's not a man in here that doesn't feel the same
          G               C                      Em
As you're walking out the door there's nothing I can do
  C                 D                         G
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you


[Bridge]
           C                Em                 D
Yeah, it's once in my life, Wish that I wasn't alone with myself
  C                     Em                          D
I feel like a child, It seems that I can't think of anyone else, Yeah!

[Verse 3]
G             C                       G
 The night is over and I guess you're gone
          G              C                     Em
I try and tell myself forget it and just carry on
         G                 C                         Em
But as I walk these lonely streets with nothing else to do
  C                 D                         G
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
  C                 D                         Em
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
  C                 D                         Em
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
