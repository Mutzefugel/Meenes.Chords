Swing Low Sweet Chariot

[Chorus]
      D          G    D
Swing low, sweet chariot,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
      D7         G    D
Swing low, sweet chariot,
              A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.

  D                       G          D
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,
                       A7
Comin' for to carry me home.
  D              G            D
A band of angels comin' after me,
              A7       D
Comin' for to carry me home.
