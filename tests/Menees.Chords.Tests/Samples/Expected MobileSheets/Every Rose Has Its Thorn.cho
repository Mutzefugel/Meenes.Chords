{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G] [Cadd9] [G] [Cadd9]
[G]  We both lie silently still in the [Cadd9]dead of the night
Although we [G]both lie close together, we feel [Cadd9]miles apart inside
Was it some[G]thing I said or som[Cadd9]ething I did
Did the words[G] not come out righ[Cadd9]t
Though I [D]tried not to hurt you
Though I [Cadd9]tried, but I guess that's why they say
{end_of_verse}


{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn
Just like [G]every co[D]wboy sings hi[Cadd9]s sad, sad so[G]ng
Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn
{end_of_chorus}


{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G] [Cadd9] [G] [Cadd9]
[G]I listen to our favorite song playing on the [Cadd9]radio
Hear the D[G]J say love's a game of easy come and [Cadd9]easy go
But I won[G]der does [Cadd9]he know
Has he e[G]ver felt like thi[Cadd9]s
And I know[D] that you'd be here right now
If I[Cadd9]     could have let you know somehow I guess
{end_of_verse}


{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn
Just like [G]every co[D]wboy sings hi[Cadd9]s sad, sad so[G]ng
Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn
{end_of_chorus}


{start_of_verse: Bridge}
[Em]   Though it's been a [D]while now
I can [Cadd9]still feel so much [G]pain    [g]  [f#]   [*bass notes]
[Em]   Like a knife that [D]cuts you the wound heals
[Cadd9]     But the scar, that scar [G]remains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G] [Cadd9] [G] [Cadd9]
[G]  I know I could have saved a love that night If I'd [Cadd9]known what to say
[G]  Instead of makin' love We both [Cadd9]made our separate ways
But now I [G]hear you found some[Cadd9]body new
And [G]that I never meant that [Cadd9]much to you
To [D]hear that tears me up inside
And to [Cadd9]see  you cuts me like a knife I guess
{end_of_verse}


{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its [Cadd9]thorn
Just like [G]every night has its [Cadd9]dawn
