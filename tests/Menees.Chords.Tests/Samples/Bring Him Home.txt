[Intro]
G C    4x

 
[Verse 1]
D       G     C        G
 God on high,  hear my prayer,
C      Bm    Am         C           D
 In my need,   you have always been there.
D      G      C     G
 He is young,  he's afraid,
C        B     B7       Em
 Let him rest,   heaven blessed,


[Chorus]
Em          C     C/B          Am
  Bring him home,    bring him home,
D7          G
  Bring him home.


[Bridge]
Bm                               Am
  He's like the son I might have known,
Em                        D
  If god had granted me a son.
            C           G
The summers die, one by one,
              C           G
How soon they fly, on and on,
         Am               B
And I am old, and will be gone.

D          G      C          G
 Bring him peace,  bring him joy,
C      Bm     Am      C      D
 He is young,   he is only a boy.
D        G     C        G
 You can take,  you can give,
C        B   B7        Em
 Let him be,   let him live.


[Outro]
Em     C    C/B       Am
  If I die,    let me die, 
D7        G
  Let him live
C          G
 Bring him home,
C          G
 Bring him home, 
C       C*   G*
 Bring… him… home.
